<h2>Before Diary</h2>

<hr />

<p>I said I want to try something new everyday but, First I'm busy on review <strong>Computer Organization And Architecture</strong>. So I don't spend much time on my blog.<del>nor on study</del><sub>even spend much time on bilibili.</sub></p>

<hr />

<h2> About Sleep</h2>

<p>I try to sleep early, but it doesn't work out yet. It might due to bioclock, as I have slept late for weeks, it's normal that I can't get used to new timetable.<strong>I'm not lazy tks:)</strong>

<p>I try to get up early this morning and I did it, but I'm a little bit tired now. It's 2:00 now, maybe I should go back to dormitory for rest every moon, I'm worry about my efficiency afternoon and tomorrow test. If it doesn't turn better I may give up before 4.
