<hr />

<p>It has been long time since I want to eastablish a blog for a long time. At last I decide to use a flame, html and css has a long way to go, and I don't have enough time: I need to master Linux and Operations
</p>

<p>I will try my best to update diary everyday in English. Thought I don't regist the CET6 this year. But I thought it's also a important ability to read English Literature.
</p>

<p>
	And I thought it will be very important to me to write down these feeling, these passing by. It can remind me of what happened before, which means a lot to me. I fing it become more hard to remember what happened few seconds ago, I thought I may catch something uncomfortable, but it doesn't matter, I believe I can get over it. For those happiness days in the future, I have dreamed of going many places, and have many things not bought yet, I can't just stay here waiting for it comeing to me, I will grasp it. = w =
